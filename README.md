### Reaction Duel
A simple reaction based game written using JS and HTML Canvas.

#### Gameplay
The players stand by and wait for a prompt to appear on the screen. Depending on the prompt the players have to either be quick to press or keep on standing by. Pressing on the correct prompt will give the player a point, pressing on incorrect prompts will give the opponent a point.

#### Characters and sprites
Right now it has a dragon ball based style but that can easily be changed. To change into a different style one must simply change the character-sprites and background. Keep in mind there are sprites for all animations aswell. More animations are also easily added in the playerSprite class.
